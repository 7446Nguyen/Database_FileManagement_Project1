# Performance Measures of Database Types and Transformation Methods
##Hello and welcome!##
Our goal is to identify storage and data transformation solutions that minimize resource usage. This will be done by comparing performance differences between writing and reading data into and out of MySQL or NoSQL databases in the extract and load phases of ETL in a local environment. Additionally, we want to compare performance differences between Python Pandas and NVIDIA RAPIDS GPU optimized data science software package in the “transform” phase of the ETL process.

## Folder Descriptions
**Reports and Findings** 
- IEEE formatted project proposal and final reports are contained here.

**data**  
- All raw data and performance data can be accessed in the folder.

**scripts**  
- Files related to data manipulation, database scripting, and transformation are located here.  Data manipulation and transformation were performed using Juypter Notebook for all ETL processes, and RStudio was used for inital data preparation.  MySQL was used to create schemas and tables for the relational database, while a referential model containing collections and documents for NoSQL database were created using MongoDB.
