# Performance Measures of Database Type and Transformation Methods
Hello and welcome! Our goal is to identify storage and data transformation solutions that minimize resource usage. This will be done by comparing performance differences between writing and reading data into and out of MySQL or NoSQL databases in the extract and load phases of ETL in a local environment. Additionally, we want to compare performance differences between Python Pandas and NVIDIA RAPIDS GPU optimized data science software package in the “transform” phase of the ETL process.
